# 5-Step Data Story Framework
*Example: Staten Island Express Buses & Congestion Pricing*

## 1. Context – Why this story matters
Staten Island express buses are a critical link for commuters into Manhattan. Congestion pricing in central NYC may shift traffic patterns, impacting travel times and reliability for these buses.

## 2. Data – What’s powering your story
Daily average bus speed data from 2023–2025 for all Staten Island express routes, paired with congestion pricing start dates.

## 3. Insights – Key findings and patterns
After congestion pricing began in January 2025:  
- **Morning peak speeds for the SIM1 route increased by 10% on average**.  
- SIM5 route saw no significant change.  

This suggests that drivers rerouted or avoided certain corridors, benefiting some express bus lines more than others.

## 4. Narrative – Tell a story the audience can follow
“The congestion pricing zone nudged traffic away from Manhattan-bound lanes. Commuters on SIM1 now experience smoother rides and shorter travel times, while SIM5 buses remain affected by local bottlenecks outside the congestion zone. This shows uneven effects of policy on different routes.”

## 5. Action – Concrete steps or recommendations
- **Adjust scheduling** for SIM1 to optimize service during faster travel windows.  
- **Identify bottlenecks on SIM5** for infrastructure improvements or signal adjustments.  
- **Monitor post-congestion patterns** to adapt service and inform future congestion pricing policies.
